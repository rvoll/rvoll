# Hey there! Welcome to my Github page.

## About me
Getting into **WebDevelopment** I'm starting off yet another project in my life. 
After studying biology for a few years, I've studied linguistics and worked as a linguist for a long time. I've mainly done research on African languages (e.g. the Khoisan language Nama/Khoekhoe in South Africa or the Bantoid language Mundabli in Cameroon). I've also taught German as a foreign language and gotten into coaching and social work. 
During my life I have travelled a lot. I have worked and lived in London, Paris, Leiden NL, in different German towns like Bonn, Regensburg and Leipzig.

In my free time, I 

- dance Blues and Lindy Hop
- go climbing
- hike
- meet friends
  
...and do other fun things. 

## Where I lived
My first flat in Leiden was on this Gracht.
