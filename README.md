## About me

I'm currently getting into **WebDevelopment** taking a course at 
[neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/web-development) in order to start off yet another project in my life. 
After studying biology for a few years, I've studied linguistics and worked as a linguist for a long time. I've mainly done research on African languages (e.g. the Khoisan language Nama/Khoekhoe in South Africa or the Bantoid language Mundabli in Cameroon). I've also taught German as a foreign language and gotten into coaching and social work. 
During my life I have travelled a lot. I have worked and lived in Namibia, London, South Africa, Cameroon, Paris, Leiden (NL) and in different German towns like Bonn, Regensburg and Leipzig.

In my free time I 

- dance Blues and Lindy Hop
- go climbing
- hike
- spend time with my kids
- meet friends

## Where I lived
My first flat in Leiden was on this beautiful Gracht.
